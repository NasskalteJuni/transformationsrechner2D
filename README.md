<p>This is a little project, in which I try to build a prototype of a small website with the purpose of calculating and displaying transformationmatrizes and their transformation. <br/>
My goal is increasing my Javascript-skills and learning vor a computergraphic-exam.<br/>
Therefore i will <strong>only use Javascript</strong> (and HTML5), it is intended to calculate everything at the <strong>client</strong>, whithout using serverside javascript.<br/>
The goal of the project is not to host the resulting website or create an application based on it.<br/>
I do not take responsibility for potential damages resulting in using the code.<p>
