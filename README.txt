This is a little project, in which I try to build a prototype of a small website with the purpose of calculating and displaying
transformationmatrizes and their transformation. My goal is increasing my Javascript-skills and learning vor a computergraphic-exam.
Therefore i will only use Javascript (and HTML5), it is intended to calculate everything at the client, whithout using serverside javascript.
The goal of the project is not to host the resulting website or create an application based on it.
I do not take responsibility for potential damages resulting in using the code.
